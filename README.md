# Contact Book

## About

This is a pet project implementing a contact book with editable fields and values.

All data stores in localStorage, so you can use it in [your browser](https://ksh-vue-contact-book.herokuapp.com/).

## Key Features

- Only First name is required to add new contact to your 'book'

- Any value for new info field (except for colon, it is a delimiter)

- Custom field names and values

- But you can then add colon when editing field's value! (sic)

- No input check (so you can input friend's phone numbers in favourite format, e.g. +l33tc00k135<3)

- `/book` page only shows general information for each contact

- Totally free (0.00$) to use!

- Unique ability to provide feedback via github
