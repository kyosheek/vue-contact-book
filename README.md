# vue-contact-book

## About

This is a pet project implementing a contact book with editable fields and values.

All data stores in localStorage, so you can use it in [your browser](https://ksh-vue-contact-book.herokuapp.com/).

## Key Features

- Only First name is required for contacts

- Any strings and numbers will suffice (use anything but letters and numbers at your own risk!)

- Custom field names

- No input check (be careful not to confuse email and phone number)

- `/book` page only shows full name and working place

- Totally free (0.00$) to use!

- Unique ability to provide feedback via github
